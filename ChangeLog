2010-03-14  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Release 0.4.0

	* Many improvements in the build scripts and Makefiles. The build for
	  Windows uses the --cross-compile option with the configure script.
	  The external scripts to build for Windows, provided with the older
	  versions are no longer necessary. Now the DLLs are created in the
	  right way.
	  The pkg-config files are now available for libfosfat and libfosgra.

	* libfosgra: add support for the decoding of .COLOR files.

	* fosmount: add the convertion on the fly of .COLOR files to .XPM files.
	  Note that the XPM files use the version 2 of X PixMap. It needs a real
	  application like The Gimp in order to read the files. Or the tool SXPM
	  from the X11 (X.Org) project.

	* smascii: add a manpage. Thanks to Didier Raboud from Debian.

	* libw32disk: this library doesn't rely anymore to C++. It is now fully
	  rewritten in C with a proper license in order to be redistribuable by
	  Debian.

2009-07-07  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* New beta released 0.3.2

	* libfosgra: new library to support .IMAGE decoding.

	  to PBM (portable bitmap format) with libfosgra.

	* Fix doxygen, packaging and Makefiles.

	* libw32disk: add C wrapper to use original Disk.cxx class with
	  libfosfat.

	  directory. Add support to list and restore deleted files.

2007-12-13  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: first implementation of an undelete tool just disabled by
	  default. The next step is added some options to list and restore
	  files.

2007-12-12  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: add support for multiple devices. A new main structure is
	  used instead of global variables. Only the logger is always global.

2007-12-09  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Fourth beta released 0.2.3

	* Some fixes, cleaned code, ...

2007-07-07  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Third beta released 0.2.2

2007-06-29  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: change the auto detection function for a better way. Use
	  the name was very bad because a lot of disks have no name. Then the
	  test is does with the CHK (look the code for more informations).

2007-06-24  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Add auto detection for the disk type. The type can be forced with
	  fosmount and fosread if necessary.

	* libfosfat: an internal logger can be enabled to know what the FOS is
	  doing. A new option is available in fosread and fosmount.

2007-06-22  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Second beta released 0.2.1

	* Add support for symbolic links. The Smaky's soft links are now
	  converted to symlink.

	* libfosfat: the cache is now released when the device is closed.

2007-06-20  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: a new system of caching is implemented to improve the
	  speed. Now that will be very fast for looking in a directory. The
	  system must be fixed for that the memory is released.

	* fosmount: a bug is fixed for that FUSE is always loaded as
	  single-thread. If not there is a really a big problem when data are
	  loaded with libfosfat.

2007-05-10  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* First beta released 0.2.0

2007-04-29  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	  --version options.

	  (ISO-8859-1) files.

2007-03-22  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: change all long variables for int because the FOS uses only
	  32 bits addresses. The lpow() function is removed and it was used only
	  for the c2l() function. Then a shift register is enough and faster.

2007-03-19  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: add a test for CHK value in BD and BL. If this value
	  changes, then NULL is returned and not the block.
	  A lot of possible segfaults are fixed and now that is possible to list
	  the smaky's system directory without killing Fuse.
	  The smaky's soft-link are now listed like a simple file. In the futur,
	  that will be translated to an symbolic unix link.

	* fosmount: fix possible segfault and add the creation date to listed
	  files.

2007-03-18  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: a lot of segfaults fixed.

2007-03-17  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: some bugfixes and malloc are now checked. All variables as
	  input of each function are tested for not to be NULL.

2007-03-15  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Some bugfixes in fosread and configure script.

	  fosread or both.

	* libfosfat: add high level functions to work with the FOS's files. Now
	  the processing with the blocks is not available in public. The fosread
	  tool have been adapted in this way.

	* fosmount: add a very simple FUSE extension that works with libfosfat.

2006-11-26  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Initial import of libfosfat and fosread.
