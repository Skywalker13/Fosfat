	* Add configure script with some options for compile
	only fosmount, fosread or both.

	* libfosfat: add high level functions for work with
	the FOS's files. Now the processing with the blocks
	is not available in public. The fosread tool have been
	adapted in this way.

	* fosmount: add a very simple FUSE extension that works
	with libfosfat.
