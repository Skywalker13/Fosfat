2007-06-29  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: change the auto detection function for a
	better way. Use the name was very bad because a lot
	of disks have no name. Then the test is does with the
	CHK (look the code for more informations).

2007-06-24  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Add auto detection for the disk type. The type can
	be forced with fosmount and fosread if necessary.

	* libfosfat: an internal logger can be enabled for
	know what the FOS is doing. A new option is available
	in fosread and fosmount.

2007-06-22  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* Second beta released 0.2.1

	* Add support for symbolic links. The Smaky's soft
	links are now converted to symlink.

	* libfosfat: the cache is now released when the device
	is closed.

2007-06-20  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: a new system of caching is implemented
	for improve the speed. Now that will be very fast for
	looking in a directory. The system must be fixed for
	that the memory is released.

	* fosmount: a bug is fixed for that FUSE is always
	loaded as single-thread. If not there is a really a
	big problem when datas are loaded with libfosfat.

	Extended ASCII (ISO-8859-1) files.

2007-03-22  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: change all long variables for int because
	the FOS uses only 32 bits addresses.
	The lpow() function is removed and it was used only for
	the c2l() function. Then a shift register is enough and
	faster.

2007-03-19  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	* libfosfat: add a test for CHK value in BD and BL.
	If this value changes, then NULL is returned and not
	the block.
	A lot of possible segfaults are fixed and now that
	is possible for list the smaky's system directory
	without to kill Fuse.
	The smaky's soft-link are now listed like a simple
	file. In the futur, that will be translated to an
	symbolic unix link.

	* fosmount: fix possible segfault and add the creation
	date to listed files.

2007-03-18  Mathieu Schroeter <mathieu.schroeter@gamesover.ch>

	the FOS's files. Now the processing with the blocks

	adapted in this way.

	with libfosfat.
