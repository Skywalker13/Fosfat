FOSFAT
~~~~~~

Fosfat is a library for a read-only access on Smaky FOS
(File Operating System). Floppy disk and hard disk are
supported.

Two tools are available for work with a Smaky FOS formatted
disk. The first tool 'fosread' can work directly with your
device but it is limited for an console utilisation.
The tool 'fosmount' uses FUSE for mount in _read-only_ your
device in your tree.
You can compile 'fosmount' with >=fuse-2.5.x. Maybe it works
with older version but it needs to test.

Look the help with each application for the command line. Or
look on the website.


BUILD
~~~~~

 ./configure
 make
 make install

It will install 'fosread' and 'fosmount' in your local
directory. Use `./configure --help` for more informations.

 make install-lib

The include is fosfat.h.
For more informations, consult the comments in the sources.
