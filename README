FOSFAT
~~~~~~

Fosfat is a library for a read-only access on Smaky FOS
(File Operating System) and SAMOS (Smaky And Micro-floppy Operating System).
Binary dump disk image, floppy disk and hard disk are supported.

Some tools are available to work with a Smaky FOS and MOS formatted disk.
The first tool 'fosread' (and 'mosread') can work directly with your device but
it is limited for a console use.
The tool 'fosmount' uses FUSE to mount in read-only your device in your
tree. And you can convert the smaky's text files with smascii. You can
compile 'fosmount' with >=fuse-3.x.
'fosrec' can be used to restore all deleted files. To restore only one file,
this action must be performed by 'fosread' ('mosread').

Look the help with each application for the command line. Or look on the
website.

This project supports FOS formatted disk used by the Smaky 8, Smaky 100,
and more and the SAMOS support for Smaky 6 formatted disks.
About the FOS disks, a tool ('fosdd') can be used to convert a disk image
to a floppy image and vice-versa. It can be very useful to convert a disk
image to floppy image if you want to mount the image with the Smaky Infini.

Fosfat includes an image library named Fosgra (libfosgra) which can be used
to convert .IMAGE and .COLOR files to usual BMP file format.


BUILD
~~~~~

 * For POSIX

   ./configure
   make
   make install

   It will install 'fosdd', 'fosread', 'mosread', 'fosmount', 'fosrec',
   'smascii', libfosgra and libfosfat in your local directory.
   Use `./configure --help` for more informations.

 * For Window$ (only fosdd, fosread, mosread, fosrec and smascii)

   # 32 bit
   ./configure --cross-compile --cross-prefix=i686-w64-mingw32-
   # 64 bit
   ./configure --cross-compile --cross-prefix=x86_64-w64-mingw32-
   make

   It will compile all DLLs and binaries for win32 with MinGW.


The public includes are fosfat.h and fosgra.h.
