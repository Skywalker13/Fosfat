FOSFAT
~~~~~~

Fosfat is a library for a read-only access on Smaky FOS
(File Operating System). Floppy disk and hard disk are supported.

Some tools are available to work with a Smaky FOS formatted disk. The first
tool 'fosread' can work directly with your device but it is limited for an
console use.
The tool 'fosmount' uses FUSE to mount in read-only your device in your
tree. And you can convert the smaky's text files with smascii. You can
compile 'fosmount' with >=fuse-2.6.x.
'fosrec' can be used to restore all deleted files. To restore only one file,
this action must be performed by 'fosread'.

Look the help with each application for the command line. Or look on the
website.


BUILD
~~~~~

   ./configure
   make
   make install

   It will install 'fosread', 'fosmount', 'fosrec', 'smascii', libfosgra

   Use `./configure --help` for more informations.

 * For Window$ (only fosread, fosrec and smascii)

   ./configure --cross-compile --cross-prefix=i586-mingw32msvc-
