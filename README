FOSFAT
~~~~~~

Fosfat is a library for a read-only access on Smaky FOS
(File Operating System). Floppy disk and hard disk are supported.

Some tools are available for work with a Smaky FOS formatted disk. The first
tool 'fosread' can work directly with your device but it is limited for an
console utilisation.
The tool 'fosmount' uses FUSE for mount in _read-only_ your device in your
tree. And you can convert the smaky's text files with smascii. You can
compile 'fosmount' with >=fuse-2.6.x.

Look the help with each application for the command line. Or look on the
website.


BUILD
~~~~~

 ./configure
 make
 make install

It will install 'fosread', 'fosmount' and 'smascii' and libfosfat in your
local directory.
Use `./configure --help` for more informations.

The include is fosfat.h.
For more informations, consult the comments in the sources.

You can found others informations on the website :
http://home.gna.org/fosfat/
