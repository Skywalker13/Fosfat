Description: Library Fosfat and FUSE extension
 Fosfat is a C library for providing read-only access to a Smaky
 formatted disk. Currently, only a tool and a FUSE extension that
 use this library can be used for reading a directory and copying
 a file. Smaky was a system developed in Switzerland at the EPFL
 (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne).
